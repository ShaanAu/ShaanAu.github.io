Iâ€™m a Data Science Apprentice at Santander UK, Founder at GenZoomer.ai, technology enthusiast and youth activist.

I have a strong interest in Engineering and Data and strive to make a difference using a combination of the two.

My career started within 2017 when I helped out Suneeta Cosmetics Ltd, my family business, in running the technical side of the business. This was by developing the websites, implementing SEO and leveraging the data provided to target customers who were likely to leave by offering them a promotion.

I am currently working within Data Science at Santander UK, which allows me to combine my creativity and passion for programming, in developing data solutions across the bank, whilst rotating across various teams.

In 2020, I am currently working on GenZoomer.ai which is a platform dedicated to providing young individuals a platform to express their thoughts, with a core focus on technology and career advice. I led the developoment of the website and am looking to recruit a team of enthusiastic writers.
