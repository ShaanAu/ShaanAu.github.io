I'm a Data Science Degree Apprentice at Santander UK, Founder at GenZoomer.ai, technology enthusiast and youth activist.

I truly believe that many companies are not leveraging data to its full potential, and is why I have a strong interest in decision science, to help companies make well-informed decisions.

My career started within 2017, when I helped out Suneeta Cosmetics Ltd, my family business, in running the technical side of the business, from developing the websites, implementing a marketing statergy for the company, implementing SEO and leveraging the data provided to target customers who were likely to leave by offering them a promotion.

I am currently working within Data Science at Santander UK, which allows me to combine my passion for programming and my creativity, in creating effective data solutions across the bank, whilst rotating across various teams ranging from teams within Corporate and Investment Banking to teams within the Retail Bank.

In 2020, I succesfully lauched GenZoomer.ai which is a platform dedicated in providing young indivduals a platform to express their thoughts, with a core focus on technology and career advice, I helped develop the website and manage a team of enthusiastic writers as well as a podcast on the site.
