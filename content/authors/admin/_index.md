Iâ€™m a Data Science Degree Apprentice at Santander UK, where I rotate across various teams within the bank whilst obtaining an undergraduate degree in Data Science. 

I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from ***chatbots***, ***churn models*** and ***credit risk*** projects using a wide range of technologies but primarily ***Python***, ***SQL*** and ***SAS***.
