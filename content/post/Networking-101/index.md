One skill that they don’t teach you at school and what I recently knew very little about, networking. How does one network? It is arguably one of the most sought out skills from the younger generation, who are savvier in terms of hard skills, subsequently neglecting the soft skills.

One word, for any young professionals regardless of where you live, regardless of where you are, networking is key to job-hunting. Regardless of how skilled you are within your particular profession, you may be the worlds best coder, the worlds best lawyer, however, if you have no-one to vouch for you, it makes the legitimacy of your claim less substantial. By networking, you have the chance to almost “cut-out” part of the application process where you need to ap[ly for jobs, by having a network of people available to you, the jobs will come to you rather than the other way round.

Linkedin. What is that? Only the internets most used platform by job seekers. The trick is too not apply to jobs directly, but to reach out to others within the company. Directors, people within your field, someone that you can idolize too. Arrange a meeting in person, or if you live in an unreasonable destination for a meet-up in person, ask for a phone call or Zoom meeting. I promise you, people when they see you make a conscious effort to network, will go out of there way to meet up with you. I was surprised when I started networking via Linkedin, how many people I was able to reach, especially by living in London I have had the opportunity to meet some incredible individuals.

Next is specific networking events, this can be through Eventbrite or an alternative platform. Attend them, regardless of how you perceive them, the only way you can network is if there are new people to meet, right. So what better way to meet with like-minded people who also want to meet new people. Go up to people and make engaging conversations, don’t have one-sided conversations make sure both yourself and the other person you are talking to are both conversing. If you don’t live in a place feasible to attend networking events, I have one word for you, webinars. These are great ways to meet new people without having the facilities to meet in person and can expose you to multiple people throughout the globe.

One of the key tips that I would recommend to any young person is to not pigeon-hole themselves in their own industry. What does that mean? Do not only network with people within the same job function as yourself. For example, I work within Data Science at Santander, pigeon-holing would mean only networking with people within technology, within the finance sector or/and within the same company. Whilst it is obviously beneficial to have these types of people in your network. Expand, network with people from different job families to different companies, you never know what the future may hold and having a broad network allows you to explore different opportunities within the future.

What I struggled with a lot and I know a lot of people within the Gen Z generation struggle with is accepting failure if you send a message to a person on Linkedin and don’t receive a response. Go the next time knowing you gave it your best shot and I can promise you there are many individuals out there who love to network, and not only are they giving up their time to meet you, you are giving up your time to meet them, which they will be aware of. They will be aware that you are going out of your way to meet them.

If I missed anything out which you think is really vital to networking, don’t be afraid to let me know, but that is my take on networking as a young professional based in London, hopefully you can apply some of these yourself and you never know what might be a result of it. One small change in your career can possibly dictate how the rest of your working life may work out, the butterfly effect.
