  <div class="article-container">

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>I hear many people talking about how they don’t have the time to follow up on their passion, to create their side-hustle based on their interests, or perhaps just a money-making venture. But in this modern world of technology and with more and more countries going into lockdown to prevent COVID-19, it seems now is the best time, if any to start your own business or side-venture and how I went about it.</p>
<p><strong>What are your skills and what are your interests?</strong></p>
<p>A side-hustle will usually be based around one of two things, your skills or your interests. If you have a knack for creating websites, become a freelance web-designer, if you have a passion for making pottery, set up a business for making pottery. It is completely up to you and there is no right or wrong answer, whilst your side-hustle doesn’t have to be your passion, it can’t hurt if it is, right? When you’re feeling most down and don’t feel like you have the energy to complete tasks, a passionate side venture is less likely to be neglected than a side hustle where you’re almost forcing yourself to complete.</p>
<p><strong>Not enough time in the day? Make more time</strong></p>
<p>At first, I would usually come home between 6:30 pm - 7:30 pm and feel like there isn’t enough time in the day for me to take my idea any further, and would mindlessly binge-watch Netflix until the end of the day. However, that is no excuse at all create time, work on the weekends where possible, pull up your laptop on your commute. There is always an excuse available, true willpower is to ignore your excuses and to keep working on your inspired mission.</p>
<p><strong>Change Your Mindset</strong></p>
<p>This was a huge change for me, before AI Elevation, I have had various ideas within the past, but failed to act on them, thinking they were unreachable, and that I am still young, there is still time to make a difference within the future. But then, I had a realization that I was 18 and the goals that I had set myself when I was young were hardly achieved. Hence, acting on what you want to achieve is one of the biggest pieces of advice I could give, and instil a growth mindset, that you can always learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Give Up, Failure is Natural</strong></p>
<p>Failure is only a natural path of creating a side venture, there are times when you may think, ahh this isn’t me. You may think this is wasted time, or you may run into an obstacle which you can’t climb. Regardless, you may need to scrap an idea but never scrap your drive to succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Find a Partner with the Same Drive as you</strong></p>
<p>Completely optional, but finding a partner who believes in your vision will give you the boost you need in days where you don’t have the energy to fulfil your idea and vice-versa. I was fortunate enough to meet my partner in Sixth Form, and he has been one of my closest friends since, helping me in creating the very website you are working on right now.</p>
<p><strong>Network Like Crazy</strong></p>
<p>Networking is arguably the most important skill to have within your arsenal, regardless of your skills related to a job, you may be the best Software Engineer on the earth, however, is the only person who can vouch for you is yourself, it doesn’t build up credibility. I have had the opportunity to meet some incredible people on my journey so far, and your biggest asset is Linkedin. Attend those events, register for the online webinars and most importantly have fun whilst doing it. You never know who you can meet from one of these events, they could give you the spark you need.</p>
<p><strong>Find A Mentor</strong></p>
<p>Before my apprenticeship, I was oblivious to how much I didn’t know in terms of soft skills, however, I was fortunate enough to stumble across a mentor figure career-wise at an internal networking event at Santander. Whilst he works in a completely different area of the business from myself, the advice I have received is invaluable.from soft skills, networking to general finance.</p>
<p><strong>Self Learning &gt; Mindless Learning</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps a controversial opinion, but I’m going to state it anyway, from personal experience I have always found that self-learning is much more effective than the learning within the traditional educational system. Only because, when you dedicate your time to reading that book, taking that online course, you fill more obliged to thoroughly learn the contents of the activity, rather than education where you memorize a textbook for an exam, then you never use it again in your life.</p>
<p><strong>Financially Educate Yourself</strong></p>
<p>I am guilty of this myself, by not being financially educated as well as I could be to deal with personal and business finances, perhaps there is a cheaper alternative to something you’re investing in, perhaps you are missing out on grants that could be used i.e. R&amp;D grants for small businesses. As much as Finance can be challenging at times, it is important to understand the implications and benefits of your financial actions.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Forget About Marketing</strong></p>
<p>It could be argued marketing is the most important aspect of creating a business, you may create the best product in the world, only for no-one to be aware of the existence of the product, this is where marketing comes into play. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin are all your best friends, whilst you don’t require sponsored advertisements, they do help. Also, word-of-mouth marketing is surprisingly effective if your service/product is of high quality.</p>
<p><strong>So What Are You Waiting For?</strong></p>
<p>Now is the perfect time to start with the increasing amount of countries in lockdown, don’t procrastinate, start today, remember Rome wasn’t built in one day, and failure is only natural, it’s how you react to failure that defines your success.</p>
