How does one network? It is arguably one of the most sought out skills from the younger generation, who are savvier in terms of hard skills, subsequently neglecting the soft skills.\nOne word, for any young professionals regardless of where you live, regardless of where you are, networking is key to job-hunting. Regardless of how skilled you are within your particular profession, you may be the worlds best coder, the worlds best lawyer, however, if you have no-one to vouch for you, it makes the legitimacy of your claim less substantial. By networking, you have the chance to almost “cut-out” part of the application process where you need to ap[ly for jobs, by having a network of people available to you, the jobs will come to you rather than the other way round.\nLinkedin. What is that? Only the internets most used platform by job seekers. The trick is too not apply to jobs directly, but to reach out to others within the company. Directors, people within your field, someone that you can idolize too. Arrange a meeting in person, or if you live in an unreasonable destination for a meet-up in person, ask for a phone call or Zoom meeting. I promise you, people when they see you make a conscious effort to network, will go out of there way to meet up with you. I was surprised when I started networking via Linkedin, how many people I was able to reach, especially by living in London I have had the opportunity to meet some incredible individuals.\nNext is specific networking events, this can be through Eventbrite or an alternative platform. Attend them, regardless of how you perceive them, the only way you can network is if there are new people to meet, right. So what better way to meet with like-minded people who also want to meet new people. Go up to people and make engaging conversations, don’t have one-sided conversations make sure both yourself and the other person you are talking to are both conversing. If you don’t live in a place feasible to attend networking events, I have one word for you, webinars. These are great ways to meet new people without having the facilities to meet in person and can expose you to multiple people throughout the globe.\nOne of the key tips that I would recommend to any young person is to not pigeon-hole themselves in their own industry. What does that mean? Do not only network with people within the same job function as yourself. For example, I work within Data Science at Santander, pigeon-holing would mean only networking with people within technology, within the finance sector or/and within the same company. Whilst it is obviously beneficial to have these types of people in your network. Expand, network with people from different job families to different companies, you never know what the future may hold and having a broad network allows you to explore different opportunities within the future.\nWhat I struggled with a lot and I know a lot of people within the Gen Z generation struggle with is accepting failure if you send a message to a person on Linkedin and don’t receive a response. Go the next time knowing you gave it your best shot and I can promise you there are many individuals out there who love to network, and not only are they giving up their time to meet you, you are giving up your time to meet them, which they will be aware of. They will be aware that you are going out of your way to meet them.\nIf I missed anything out which you think is really vital to networking, don’t be afraid to let me know, but that is my take on networking as a young professional based in London, hopefully you can apply some of these yourself and you never know what might be a result of it. One small change in your career can possibly dictate how the rest of your working life may work out, the butterfly effect.\n","date":1555977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555977600,"objectID":"3340dac22c05d36627aba9fbba324c5c","permalink":"/post/networking-101/","publishdate":"2019-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/networking-101/","section":"post","summary":"How I network as a young professional in London.","tags":["Networking","Career"],"title":"Networking 101","type":"post"},{"authors":["Shaan Aucharagram"],"categories":["Website"],"content":"I hear many people talking about how they don’t have the time to follow up on their passion, to create their side-hustle based on their interests, or perhaps just a money-making venture. But in this modern world of technology and with more and more countries going into lockdown to prevent COVID-19, it seems now is the best time, if any to start your own business or side-venture and how I went about it.\nWhat are your skills and what are your interests?\nA side-hustle will usually be based around one of two things, your skills or your interests. If you have a knack for creating websites, become a freelance web-designer, if you have a passion for making pottery, set up a business for making pottery. It is completely up to you and there is no right or wrong answer, whilst your side-hustle doesn’t have to be your passion, it can’t hurt if it is, right? When you’re feeling most down and don’t feel like you have the energy to complete tasks, a passionate side venture is less likely to be neglected than a side hustle where you’re almost forcing yourself to complete.\nNot enough time in the day? Make more time\nAt first, I would usually come home between 6:30 pm - 7:30 pm and feel like there isn’t enough time in the day for me to take my idea any further, and would mindlessly binge-watch Netflix until the end of the day. However, that is no excuse at all create time, work on the weekends where possible, pull up your laptop on your commute. There is always an excuse available, true willpower is to ignore your excuses and to keep working on your inspired mission.\nChange Your Mindset\nThis was a huge change for me, before AI Elevation, I have had various ideas within the past, but failed to act on them, thinking they were unreachable, and that I am still young, there is still time to make a difference within the future. But then, I had a realization that I was 18 and the goals that I had set myself when I was young were hardly achieved. Hence, acting on what you want to achieve is one of the biggest pieces of advice I could give, and instil a growth mindset, that you can always learn more.\nDon’t Give Up, Failure is Natural\nFailure is only a natural path of creating a side venture, there are times when you may think, ahh this isn’t me. You may think this is wasted time, or you may run into an obstacle which you can’t climb. Regardless, you may need to scrap an idea but never scrap your drive to succeed.\nFind a Partner with the Same Drive as you\nCompletely optional, but finding a partner who believes in your vision will give you the boost you need in days where you don’t have the energy to fulfil your idea and vice-versa. I was fortunate enough to meet my partner in Sixth Form, and he has been one of my closest friends since, helping me in creating the very website you are working on right now.\nNetwork Like Crazy\nNetworking is arguably the most important skill to have within your arsenal, regardless of your skills related to a job, you may be the best Software Engineer on the earth, however, is the only person who can vouch for you is yourself, it doesn’t build up credibility. I have had the opportunity to meet some incredible people on my journey so far, and your biggest asset is Linkedin. Attend those events, register for the online webinars and most importantly have fun whilst doing it. You never know who you can meet from one of these events, they could give you the spark you need.\nFind A Mentor\nBefore my apprenticeship, I was oblivious to how much I didn’t know in terms of soft skills, however, I was fortunate enough to stumble across a mentor figure career-wise at an internal networking event at Santander. Whilst he works in a completely different area of the business from myself, the advice I have received is invaluable.from soft skills, networking to general finance.\nSelf Learning \u0026gt; Mindless Learning\nPerhaps a controversial opinion, but I’m going to state it anyway, from personal experience I have always found that self-learning is much more effective than the learning within the traditional educational system. Only because, when you dedicate your time to reading that book, taking that online course, you fill more obliged to thoroughly learn the contents of the activity, rather than education where you memorize a textbook for an exam, then you never use it again in your life.\nFinancially Educate Yourself\nI am guilty of this myself, by not being financially educated as well as I could be to deal with personal and business finances, perhaps there is a cheaper alternative to something you’re investing in, perhaps you are missing out on grants that could be used i.e. R\u0026amp;D grants for small businesses. As much as Finance can be challenging at times, it is important to understand the implications and benefits of your financial actions.\nDon’t Forget About Marketing\nIt could be argued marketing is the most important aspect of creating a business, you may create the best product in the world, only for no-one to be aware of the existence of the product, this is where marketing comes into play. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin are all your best friends, whilst you don’t require sponsored advertisements, they do help. Also, word-of-mouth marketing is surprisingly effective if your service/product is of high quality.\nSo What Are You Waiting For?\nNow is the perfect time to start with the increasing amount of countries in lockdown, don’t procrastinate, start today, remember Rome wasn’t built in one day, and failure is only natural, it’s how you react to failure that defines your success.\n","date":1555977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555977600,"objectID":"d7342aa7791034c0e3dfc345723b6568","permalink":"/post/tips-tricks-building-a-side-project/","publishdate":"2019-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/tips-tricks-building-a-side-project/","section":"post","summary":"Some of my tips on what I did before embarking on my venture at GenZoomer.ai.","tags":["GenZoomer.ai"],"title":"Tips \u0026 Tricks on Building a Side Hustle","type":"post"},{"authors":["Shaan Aucharagram"],"categories":["Career"],"content":"Today, I want to talk about why I chose the newest type of scheme, a degree apprenticeship, over the traditional university route. But before this, I want to address some of the negative connotations that are associated with apprenticeships.\nOccasionally, you find people who when they hear about apprenticeships, they think of traditional roles such as construction, hairdressing amongst others. Whilst these types of apprenticeships still remain, since the introduction of the apprenticeship levy and degree apprenticeships in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of apprentices in sectors such as the financial sector, technology and entertainment companies. Whilst earning a qualification, in some cases a degree, this scheme may well put them ahead of graduates who find it difficult to find a role due to high levels of competition for graduate roles. These opportunities exist in roles such as Data Science, Software Engineering, Digital Marketing, Finance and various other fields.\nMany companies upon the completion of an apprenticeship will retain their employees due to their working knowledge of the existing companies facilities. For example, within technology roles, graduates who have come from university tend to have little experience working on real-life projects with deadlines. Meaning, they are not used to programming for several hours at a time, and may not understand industry practices such as the agile methodology, where tasks are completed in a more structured way. I have found that many graduates struggle to understand concepts such as version control and have limited experience using Git, the industry-standard version control software.\nHowever, I do not want to discredit the traditional university route, as I still believe it is an extremely valuable way to get a job within a company, and there are still many fields for which apprenticeships are not being advertised. Many of the most career-focused individuals I have met prefer the theoretical knowledge university aims to provide, rather than the more applied learning of apprenticeships.\nThat being said, I believe that a degree apprenticeship was the right route for me as I have a rough idea of what career I want to pursue. I believe that the opportunity to work on some of the bank’s most interesting projects, combined with the theoretical knowledge provided by the degree I will eventually earn, will provide me with a more complete learning experience.\nI highly encourage any aspiring data scientists/technologists to consider apprenticeships as well as university, even if you only have a rough idea of what career you wish to pursue. If you do not feel in the right frame of mind to make a decision, there is always the opportunity to take a year off to truly find your passion. Or, if you know that university aligns with your goals within the future, seize the opportunity with both hands and don\u0026rsquo;t look back.\nTo summarise, I would consider an apprenticeship if you:\n Have a rough idea of what you want to achieve in the future or if the career path you want to pursue offers an apprenticeship in the sector of work you want to pursue. If you work in a creative role, generally a portfolio of work will showcase your work far more than any piece of paper could ever provide. If you want to gain real-life experience for a company where you will be at the forefront of change.  On the other hand, university offers the chance to:\n Learn a more specific skill set, I was quite fortunate in gaining a place on one of the only Data Science degree apprenticeships, however, university offers a wider range of subjects. If you want to enter a profession where university is required, such as Medicine or Law. However, even then, attitudes are starting to change. Have more free time, this is often overlooked however at university, you\u0026rsquo;ll have the freedom to pursue any idea you have without the constraints of a full-time job.  That is my take on apprenticeships compared with university. I found that an apprenticeship aligned with my goals, and through it, I have gained invaluable experience. However, each person should follow your gut instinct as that is generally where you will be most fulfilled within your career. All the best in your journeys and if you need any support, feel free to reach out to me.\n","date":1555718400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555718400,"objectID":"1059772b8e6bb8c18691dfa2f29d4c6f","permalink":"/post/degree-apprenticeship-over-uni/","publishdate":"2019-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/degree-apprenticeship-over-uni/","section":"post","summary":"My thoughts on the traditional university route vs the modern degree apprenticeship path.","tags":["Apprenticeships"],"title":"Why I Chose A Degree Apprenticeship Over University","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"adfde6528264cf02951cd0222680f518","permalink":"/project/genzoomer-ai/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/genzoomer-ai/","section":"project","summary":"A global platform dedicated in offering young individuals a voice through articles \u0026 through a podcast ran by Shola West.","tags":["Website"],"title":"GenZoomer.ai","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"a86c889b60bbdc5400540fb431582e20","permalink":"/project/machine_learning_aicore/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/machine_learning_aicore/","section":"project","summary":"This repository comprises of my work where I am learning machine learning, natural language proccessing and reinforcement learning.","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"My Machine Learning Work","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"36040fded7332d3cad0addaff1ee8f32","permalink":"/project/personal_website/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/personal_website/","section":"project","summary":"My personal website, the site you are on right now made in R using the blogdown package","tags":["Website"],"title":"My Personal Website","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"b6d11a0e834a90e5f7086edae0c6360d","permalink":"/project/wing-it/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/wing-it/","section":"project","summary":"My sixth form coursework made in C# with Unity based on Flappy Bird but with additional functionality .","tags":["Other"],"title":"Year 13 Video Game - Wing It","type":"project"},{"authors":["Shaan Aucharagram"],"categories":["Machine Learning"],"content":"Hello everyone, over the past couple of years you have probably heard about the new phase within the industry regarding Artificial Intelligence. As a result, many companies have gone on to hire data specialists \u0026amp; machine learning engineers without truly understanding what they provide and whether their company has the right infrastructure set up. In light of this, I will be talking about some of the key concepts in Machine Learning which is a subset of artificial intelligence, and is the “Field of programming which gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” Arthur Samuel\nWhat does that mean exactly? Well from a very high-level (easy-to-understand) perspective it means that data is input into a model created by data scientists, which from the existing data will use the data given to the computer and make a prediction. A good example is predicting stocks, you provide data of existing stock information for the program to make a prediction of stock prices.\nThere are three main types of Machine Learning that I wish to talk about within this post, where I will go into a little bit of detail regarding how they work, for people unfamiliar with these concepts and for those wishing to refresh their memory.\nReinforcement Learning\nReinforcement learning is commonly used within fields such as Robotics \u0026amp; Game Theory and where there is a multitude of actions that can occur, given an initial state. What this means, is that the machine will learn by itself, then optimize from the previous choices made to take the next best action. This is different from the other types of machine learning which may not output the “optimised solution”. An example of this would be if you were to have a Flappy Bird game programmed by reinforcement learning, the first attempt of the bird may initially collide to the ground, then it may collide with a pole, however, reinforcement learning will eventually optimise the birds route after each failed attempt until it creates the best path for the bird, to get as far as possible in the game. This could be applied to other types of games as well, for example, an AI from a chess game, can be programmed using reinforcement learning, and from each game played it will gradually become better over time. Reinforcement learning is generally not used within the industry apart from the fields mentioned above, mainly because companies prefer to use other methods which are generally easier to program, however noticeable exceptions that are becoming increasingly popular within the industry are Chatbots and devices such as Alexa and Siri, these are examples of reinforcement learning.\nSupervised Machine Learning\nSupervised Machine Learning, is the second of the three fields within Machine Learning and by far the most popular field used within the industry. This is because Supervised Machine Learning is trained on labelled data and there is already a rough idea of what the prediction will be. For example, what mode of transport will Person A take to work? Or what is the value of Company A? Thus, before the algorithm is implemented, there is already a rough idea of what algorithm will predict. Hence, the program knows there is a value/category which the outcome can be picked from. One of the most common types of Supervised Machine Learning examples within the Data Science community is the Titanic: Machine Learning problem, where you use Classification to predict whether each passenger survives or doesn’t. I will now try and break it down further.\nThere are two main types of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms:\n Regression Classification  Classification is used in problems such as predicting what mode of transport Person A takes to work, so the training data (data which the model uses to learn from) is based on categorical data. Hence, as the classes of transport are already defined, i.e. bus, car, train etc. the question is a classification problem.\nWhereas Regression is used in problems which still have a rough idea of what value will be predicted, however, the input data is continuous and an example would be predicting the weight of Person A or the value of Company A. Hence, regression is used when you have a continuous output.\nThis can be further broken down however, for now, I will leave it at that and I hope to break it down further in a later post.\nUnsupervised Machine Learning\nFinally, the last type of Machine Learning, where you have your training data but no idea what the prediction will be based on the input data. You may be thinking, that sounds awfully similar to Reinforcement Learning? However, reinforcement learning is focused on taking the next action, i.e. simulating the next move within a Chess game. Whereas, Unsupervised Learning is more focused on finding the patterns and differences between sets of data. An example of this would be a 3D Cluster with the respective axis of age, salary and gender and thus, create its own categories for data points which have similar results on the 3D cluster.\nUnsupervised Learning is different from supervised due to assigning what data points it believes would be categories rather than having pre-defined categories such as mode of transport for Person A to work.\nUnsupervised learning will generally require more “computational” power than supervised learning, and supervised learning is generally more accurate than unsupervised learning. So where possible, it is advised to use supervised learning over unsupervised learning.\nI will delve into more detail about unsupervised learning in a different post, as I wish to keep this article about the basics, and there is so much more to explore.\nThank you for taking the time to read my “What Is Machine Learning.” I hope you found it useful, regardless of your industry \u0026amp; sector of work/education and now you won’t need to nod your head when a colleague mentions Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning without knowing what it truly achieves within the workplace.\n","date":1461110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"4ce8b9f9543d3b94e91a5ea960d97d03","permalink":"/post/machine-learning-post/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/machine-learning-post/","section":"post","summary":"Machine Learning explained in an easy-to-understand format without the jargon.","tags":["Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"What Is Machine Learning?","type":"post"}]
