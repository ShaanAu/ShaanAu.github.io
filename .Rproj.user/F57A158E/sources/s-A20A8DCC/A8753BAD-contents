Hi, you guessed it, I am Shaan. A Data Science Degree Apprentice at Santander UK. I truly believe that many companies are not leveraging Data to its full potential, and is why I have a strong interest in Decision Science. I also have a strong interest in the financial markets, and how data can be used to make informed decisions in that perspective.
